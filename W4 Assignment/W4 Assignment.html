        <h2>Game Development </h2>
        <p>Game Development is something I enjoy a lot. I've made many a game in my day.</p>
        <p>I used to make a lot of games using Scratch. I was big in the Scratch community back in the day, but over time all the friends I made there moved onto other things.</p>
        <p>I mean, so did I, but I still mess around with Scratch every so often.</p>
        <p>Here's "Tree Fighter". I made it while goofing off in my junior year intro to programming class.</p>
        <p>Since embedding a project doesn't embed the instructions, I'll paste them as written here.</p>
        <p>"Move your mouse up and down to move the fist. <br>Punch your way to victory! <br>Punching rocks is generally bad for you, so don't! <br>Press K to switch to using the up and down arrow keys!"</p>
        <!--Links to a project on Scratch. Scratch actually generates this itself, so all I needed to do was paste it.-->

        <p>I posted this to Scratch on January 14th, 2020, so it was before the pandemic as well. Truly a relic of a more hopeful time.</p>
        <p>I'm fairly certain I'm the one who set the high score in this game, as well.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/How_to_Embed_a_Project#Cloud_Data">Scratch Wiki</a>, you need to be logged into Scratch on a different tab to affect cloud variables (the high score) from an embedded project.</p>
        <p>That account also has to be over a certain age and have a certain amount of activity on it to be able to affect cloud variables.</p>
        <p>It's entirely possible I will hold the high score forever.</p>

        <h2>My Tragic Backstory</h2>
        <p>I can't open bus windows. I've never been able to do it.</p>
        <p>All my life I've ridden in buses where I think "Man, I'd love to open the window" but I can never figure out how to do it.</p>
        <p>Who designed them to be absolutely nightmarish to open, anyway?</p>
        <p>It doesn't help when everyone around me is like "Dude it's easy just push the things in and pull down" and I've tried that and it just never works. </p>
        <p>I always make a fool of myself.</p>
        <p>Anyway this is why as soon as I was able to drive I never rode a school bus again.</p>
        <p>(That, and the other kids on the bus were always obnoxious. Every school bus has some just downright evil kids riding it, and I haven't encountered anything to prove otherwise.)</p>
        <p>So I never got on a bus again.</p>
        <p>At least, not until winter break my first year of college.</p>
        <p>I still wasn't used to driving on the interstate, so instead of letting me risk it on not just the interstate but also the interstate during an Iowa Winter, my parents had me and my brother ride a Greyhound bus to Iowa and back.</p>
        <p>It was actually a series of buses, but they all looked something like this.</p>
        <img src=evilbus.jpg alt= "A Greyhound bus, or as I like to call it, the Worse Airplane" width=300>
        <p>At first, things were going smoothly. Naturally, that didn't last long.</p>
        <p>Where do I even begin?</p>
        <p>First of all, the bus out of Tempe nearly immediately broke down. I think it was because the bus ran out of coolant, but I wasn't paying attention.</p>
        <p>Next, I got on the wrong bus in Tulsa, Oklahoma and had to detour to Oklahoma City where i spent a not-insignificant amount of time waiting for another bus heading north. Remember Oklahoma City, it'll be important later.</p>
        <p>After that, I don't think much else interesting happened on the way there. It was cold, I guess?</p>
        <p>But the real horrors didn't start until I was on the way BACK.</p>
        <p>At one stop at a gas station, we had to make it back to the bus in around 15 minutes or they'd leave us behind.</p>
        <p>Me and my brother made it back okay, but apparently one of the passengers around us didn't make it.</p>
        <p>A little bit after the bus began moving again, I looked up from my phone to see the passengers around us divying up stuff from the missing passenger's bag.</p>
        <p>We were shocked. I remember asking one of them "Shouldn't you just leave it so the bus company can send their stuff back?" but they just said "The bus company won't even bother doing that, so why not go through it?"</p>
        <p>For the rest of the trip, me and my brother watched our stuff like hawks.</p>
        <p>Eventually, we made it back to Oklahoma City.</p>
        <p>Several hours went by, and our next bus was nowhere in sight.</p>
        <p>Several more hours... nothing.</p>
        <p>Apparently they were having trouble finding a driver to take us.</p>
        <p>It was getting late, and we were tired of eating overpriced gas station Subway, so we were wondering what to do about finding a place to sleep.</p>
        <p>They told us that they were trying to find us a hotel room, so we waited patiently. Surely they wouldn't make us sleep on the floor of that bus station, right?</p>
        <p>Of course, they never got back to us on that. We did, in fact, have to sleep on the floor of that bus station.</p>
        <p>It was cold, gross, and uncomfortable. We were lucky in that we had recieved blankets for Christmas, but unlucky in that we had completely forgotten about them.</p>
        <p>So we were huddled under our coats, which didn't really do all that much as blankets.</p>
        <p>The next day came, and I woke up to an uncomfortably wet mask. This was during the pandemic, so I'd been wearing one the whole time. It wasn't a problem until suddenly I didn't have one to wear anymore.</p>
        <p>I got one from the aforementioned gas station that felt far too fragile, and continued waiting. That's right, they still hadn't found a driver.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until we were faced with the possibility of another night on the floor that a bus finally showed up.</p>
        <p>We were finally leaving Oklahoma City. And if I have anything to say about it, we were never coming back.</p>
        <p>The rest of the trip was uneventful in comparison.</p>
        <p>So that's my sob story. I hope I never have to ride a Greyhound bus ever again.</p>
